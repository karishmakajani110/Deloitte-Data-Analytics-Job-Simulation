## Excel Analysis Summary

As part of the Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Experience, Excel was used to classify
employee compensation equity scores using defined fairness thresholds.

### Key Activities
- Analyzed structured compensation data containing Factory, Job Role, and Equality Score  
- Created a calculated column to automatically classify equality scores into fairness categories  
- Implemented conditional logic using absolute value checks to handle both positive and negative variances  
- Validated results using edge-case examples to ensure accurate classification  

### Classification Logic
Equality scores were categorized as:
- **Fair**: between -10 and +10  
- **Unfair**: less than -10 or greater than +10  
- **Highly Discriminative**: less than -20 or greater than +20  

### Outcome
This Excel-based classification enabled consistent identification of compensation equity
patterns and supported downstream analysis and dashboard development.

### Excel Classification Formula

The following formula was used to automatically classify equality scores
based on predefined fairness thresholds:
